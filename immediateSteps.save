Publishing via GitHub
First of all, sign up for GitHub and verify your email address.
Next, you need to create a repository to store files.
On this page, in the Repository name box, enter username.github.io, where username is your username. For example, our friend Bob Smith would enter bobsmith.github.io. Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" box. Then click Create repository.
